# ðŸš€ Zero to Swifty

Welcome to **Zero to Swifty** â€” my journey into iOS development using Swift, guided by [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) by Paul Hudson.

This repository contains code, notes, and mini-projects as I work through _Hacking with Swift_ tutorials and challenges. It's built for beginners like me who are starting from scratch and want to build real iOS apps with hands-on practice.

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives

- âœ… Master Swift basics (variables, functions, control flow, optionals, etc.)
- âœ… Build apps using SwiftUI
- âœ… Understand Xcode and Interface Builder
- âœ… Apply concepts through guided projects

## ðŸ“˜ Based On

This repo closely follows the free resources from:

ðŸ”— [**Hacking with Swift**](https://www.hackingwithswift.com)  
- _100 Days of SwiftUI_ (for SwiftUI-based apps)  
- Project-based learning with real-world apps

## ðŸ§  Why This Repo?

I created this repo to stay consistent and organized while learning iOS development. By following *Hacking with Swift* and documenting each step, I'm reinforcing what I learn and creating a helpful reference for others too.

---

## âœ… Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode installed  
- Basic familiarity with programming helps (but not required)  
- Willingness to build something every day ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This is a personal learning repo â€” it will grow over time as I complete more projects. Contributions or suggestions are welcome!

Happy hacking!
